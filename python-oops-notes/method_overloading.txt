If a class contains more than one method and has same method name->method overloading
The methods can differ by having different datatypes of parameters, a different number of parameters, or both.

Features of Method Overloading
Flexibility – allows the same method name to handle different types of input.
Readability – makes the program easier to read and understand.
Simplicity – the program is easier to work with.
Reduced Complexity – avoids unnecessary different method names for similar operations.

Method Overloading in Python
Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense because it is a dynamically typed language.
Python does not check data types at compile time.
If multiple methods with the same name are defined, only the last one is considered, and the previous ones are overridden.

Achieving Method Overloading in Python
We can achieve method overloading using the multipledispatch module.
@dispatch(datatype,datatype,...)

code:
from multipledispatch import dispatch
class A:
    @dispatch(int,int)
    def add(self,a,b):
        return a+b
    @dispatch(int,int,int)
    def add(self,a,b,c):
        return a+b+c
    @dispatch(str,str)
    def add(self,a,b):
        return a+b

obj=A()
print(obj.add(1,2,3))
print(obj.add('honey','comb'))
print(obj.add(1,2))
