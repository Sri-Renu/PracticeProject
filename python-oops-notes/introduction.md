# Python Programming Paradigms

Python supports multiple paradigms:
- **Procedural**
- **Functional**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

---

## OOP Usage
OOP is widely used in:
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Databases
- Expert Systems
- Client-Server Models

---

## OOP Approach
**Bottom-Up Approach**:  
A task is divided into smaller **components**, and solutions are built around them.

Objects represent real-world entities and have:
- **Properties (attributes/variables)**
- **Behaviours (methods/functions)**

---

## Key Features of OOP in Python
- In Python, **everything is an object** (`int`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, etc.)
- OOP helps solve **complex real-world projects** where extensibility is needed

### Advantages
- Provides **data security**  
- Allows **parallel programming**  
- Promotes **modularity & reusability**  
- Reduces **redundancy**  
- Decreases **development cost & time**  
- Makes **software maintenance easier**  
- Improves **software quality**

---

## Core OOP Concepts
- **Class** → A blueprint for creating objects; supports code reusability  
- **Object** → An instance of a class  
- **Inheritance** → Acquiring properties & methods from another class  
- **Polymorphism** → Performing a task in multiple ways (method overriding/overloading)  
- **Encapsulation** → Binding data (attributes) and methods into a single unit  
- **Abstraction** → Hiding internal details and showing only the essential features  

---

## Important Python Details
- **Class Naming Convention**: PascalCase (e.g., `MyClass`)  
- **Constructor (`__init__`)**:
  - Special method in Python (called automatically when an object is created)  
  - Used to **initialize object data** (set up variables)  
  - `self` → Reference to the current instance of the class  

---

## Methods in Python
**String Methods:**  
`upper()`, `lower()`, `islower()`, `isupper()`, `capitalize()`, etc.  

**List Methods:**  
`append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `pop()`

## Note
- Triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) define **multi-line strings**  
- If not assigned to a variable, they are often used as **multi-line comments** in Python
